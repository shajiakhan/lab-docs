# Internetworking basics - routing begins at hosts - Connecting two networks with one router in VirtualBox

## Lab Purpose

This lab will help you get started with understanding internetworking (i.e. connecting two or more networks together and moving Layer 3 datagrams between networks). It will also help you understand that routing begins at hosts as each host must decide what to do with outgoing Layer 3 datagram. We'll implement this lab in VirtualBox but a similar setup can be made using physical machines or [in cloud environments](../openstack/internetworking-basics-host-routing.md).

### Learning Outcomes

1. Basic understanding of virtualized networks using hypervisors such as VirtualBox
2. Create and deploy IP networks.
3. Create and configure routers to interconnect networks.
4. Describe routing process as initiating at the host
5. Describe routing process at a router

### Prerequisites

#### Environment

1. You should have a working VirtualBox setup with enough processor and memory capacity on your local computer
2. A small Linux-based appliance (Dr. Khan's students will receive one through the assignment page) or ability to install a lightweight Linux system from ISO files within VirtualBox.

>**Any Linux-based VirtualBox virtual machine will work but the instructions given here are for Ubuntu Server 16.04 or prior.**
>**Dr. Khan's students are advised to use the appliance provided with the assignment

#### Background Knowledge

1. Familiarity with virtualization concepts and basic working knowledge of Linux command line will be beneficial but not required.
2. Understanding of Network Addresses, Dynamic versus Static IP configuration of hosts, and theory on decision making at hosts and routers as they decide how to forward Layer 3 datagrams.

## Create your networks

You'll create private networks on which you'll launch your instances and router(s) will interconnect the networks. You can create a network from the dashboard. While creating a network, you'll also create a Subnetwork. For the subnetwork, you can pick any RFC 1918 private Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) block you wish. Example setup using private IPv4 addresses and network addresses appears below. You may choose your own network addresses if you wish (it'll be good practice).

### Create first network - "network-1"

Use the below values/inputs [while following the instructions here](../../tasks/openstack/create-network.md).

1. Network Name: `network-1` (just a name, always try to give descriptive names to your cloud resources)
2. Other inputs/check boxes: Not Shared; Admin State enabled; and create a subnet.
3. Subnet:
   * Subnet Name: `network-1-subnet`
   * Network Address: `192.168.1.0/24`
   * Gateway IP: `192.168.1.1`
   * Subnet Details:
      1. DHCP enabled
      2. DHCP Allocation Pools: `192.168.1.10,192.168.1.59`
      3. DNS SERVER: (not needed, leave blank; as these are test networks with no outside connectivity)
      4. Rest of the configuration either blank or default

### Create second network - "network-2"

Use the below values/inputs [while following the instructions here](../../tasks/openstack/create-network.md).

1. Network Name: `network-2`
2. Other inputs/check boxes: Not Shared; Admin State enabled; and create a subnet.
3. Subnet:
   * Subnet Name: `network-2-subnet`
   * Network Address: `192.168.2.0/24`
   * Gateway IP: `192.168.2.1`
   * Subnet Details:
      1. DHCP enabled
      2. DHCP Allocation Pools: `192.168.2.10,192.168.2.59`
      3. DNS SERVER: (not needed, leave blank; as these are test networks with no outside connectivity)
      4. Rest of the configuration either blank or default

## Create a router that connects network-1 with network-2

Use the below values/inputs [while following the instructions here](../../tasks/openstack/create-router.md).

1. Router name: `router-1`
2. External Network: LEAVE BLANK
3. Add interface to this router on your `network-1-subnet`:
   * IP Address: `192.168.1.1` (this will be the gateway for all instances launched in your network-1-subnet)
4. Add a second interface to this router on your `network-2-subnet`:
   * IP Address: `192.168.2.1` (this will be the gateway for all instances launched in your network-2-subnet)

## Launch Your Instances

### (If you don't already have a Key Pair setup): Create a SSH Key Pair and download to save in your .ssh directory

Use the below values/inputs [while following the instructions here](../../tasks/openstack/create-key-pair.md).

1. Key Pair Name: `ssoid-key` (replace with your ssoid or username)

### Launch Linux instance; "machine-A" on network-1

Use the below values/inputs [while following the instructions here](../../tasks/openstack/launch-ubuntu-instance.md).

1. Instance name: `machine-A`
2. Source Image: `Ubuntu-16-04` (no volumes)
3. Flavor: `s1.small`
4. Network: `network-1` (you created this network earlier;)
5. Security Group: `Default` (no need to create one, this is already present. Every OpenStack project comes with a Default security group that blocks all incoming traffic to the instances in that group and allows all outgoing traffic.)
6. Key Pair: `ssoid-key` (you created this earlier with your ssoid or username)
7. IMPORTANT - Configuration: Use a cloud-init script to set a password for your Ubuntu instance.

### Launch Linux instance; "machine-B" on network-1

Use the below values/inputs [while following the instructions here](../../tasks/openstack/launch-ubuntu-instance.md).

1. Instance name: `machine-B`
2. Source Image: `Ubuntu-16-04` (no volumes)
3. Flavor: `s1.small`
4. Network: `network-1` (you created this network earlier;)
5. Security Group: `Default` (no need to create one, this is already present. Every OpenStack project comes with a Default security group that blocks all incoming traffic to the instances in that group and allows all outgoing traffic.)
6. Key Pair: `ssoid-key` (you created this earlier with your ssoid or username)
7. IMPORTANT - Configuration: Use a cloud-init script to set a password for your Ubuntu instance.

### Launch Linux instance; "machine-C" on network-2

Use the below values/inputs [while following the instructions here](../../tasks/openstack/launch-ubuntu-instance.md).

1. Instance name: `machine-C`
2. Source Image: `Ubuntu-16-04` (no volumes)
3. Flavor: `s1.small`
4. Network: `network-2` (you created this network earlier;)
5. Security Group: `Default` (no need to create one, this is already present. Every OpenStack project comes with a Default security group that blocks all incoming traffic to the instances in that group and allows all outgoing traffic.)
6. Key Pair: `ssoid-key` (you created this earlier with your ssoid or username)
7. IMPORTANT - Configuration: Use a cloud-init script to set a password for your Ubuntu instance.

## Access your instances through the browser using HTML 5 console (noVNC)

The launch [instance instructions](../../tasks/openstack/launch-ubuntu-instance.md#accessing-your-ubuntu-instance-through-the-browser-console) provide details on how to access your instances through the browser itself. Once at the console, you click in the console and then start typing. You can login with the username `ubuntu` and the password you set in the configuration script during launch!

## Test connectivity

Connect to machine-A from the console and check it's IP address.
Connect to machine-B in another browser window and check it's IP address.
From machine-A ping the IP address of machine-B. Go to machine-B and ping the IP address of machine-A.

### Test connectivity across networks

Connect to machine-C in another browser window and check it's IP address.
Ping from machine-A to machine-C and vice-versa
Ping from machine-B to machine-C and vice-versa

### Think of how the packets move

Examine how hosts within the same network (here machine-A and machine-B communicate) at Layer 3. Similarly, examine how hosts send the Layer 3 datagrams to the default gateway for moving packets across networks. Complete the assigned readings.

## Cleaning up after you're done

1. Shutdown and delete the instances
2. Delete each of the interfaces on your router
3. Delete the router itself
4. Delete the network you created (you may have to ensure you delete all ports on this network first if you get error message when trying to delete the network)

## Learning Check - "Why this works?"

### machine-A and machine-B connectivity

These machines are on the same network as both the following are true:

1. They are connected into the same layer 2 network. Think of the physical switch analogy. In OpenStack you put both the machines on the same internal network called network-1. This would be analogous to we plugging the machines’ network cables to a switch.
2. They are on the same layer 3 network. Think both machine-A and machine-B have IPv4 addresses from the same IP network. That is, both machines’ IP addresses have the same network address prefix. In the example, machine-A’s IP 192.168.1.2/24 and machine-B’s IP 192.168.1.3/24 are on the same network address 192.168.1.0/24. Then you used ping (a small program used to send some arbitrary data to another machine and see if it responds) as the “application” sending/receiving data.

#### Expand your knowledge

Examine Routing Tables of both machine-A and machine-B
Use any of the following commands on the command prompt of the instances:

* `route -nv`
* `netstat -r`
* `ip route list`

Please study the row(s) in the routing table and understand what each row/route does, based on class discussions and readings.

### Connectivity between hosts on network-1 and network-2 (e.g., machine-A and machine-C)

machine-A and machine-C are on two separate networks as the following are true:

1. They are connected to different layer 2 networks. Think of the physical switch analogy. In OpenStack you put machine-A connected to network-1 and machine-C connected to network-2. This would be analogous to we plugging the machines’ network cables to two different network switches or more precisely two different LAN/network segments.
2. They are two different layer 3 networks. Think machine-A and machine-C have IPv4 addresses from the different IP networks. That is, the machines’ IP addresses have different network address prefixes. In the example, machine-A’s IP 192.168.1.2/24 makes it on the network address 192.168.1.0/24. On the other hand, machine-C’s IP 192.168.2.2/24 makes it on the network address 192.168.2.0/24.

So, routing for a packet going from machine-A to machine-C works as follows:

* Source Address of datagram is 192.168.1.2 and Destination address of datagram is 192.168.2.2
* machine-A examines the destination address and figures out that the destination IP is NOT on the same network as machine-A.
* So, it sends the packet to the default gateway (192.168.1.1) using the default route in machine-A’s routing table.
* router-1 receives that packet from its first interface (192.168.1.1) and examines the destination address (192.168.2.2). It figures out that the destination IP 192.168.2.2 matches a route entry in its routing table that matches all IPs in the 192.168.2.0/24 network. It knows that the 192.168.2.0/24 network is connected to its second interface. Thus, it forwards that packet out of its second interface toward machine-C.

#### Expand your knowledge - compare routing tables

Examine Routing Tables of both machine-A and machine-C. Please study the row(s) in the routing table and understand how the default routes help the machines send the packets to their router (gateway) when the destination IP addresses of any packets are not on the same network as the machines themselves.

## Cleanup your environment

It's always a good idea to delete/remove any **unwanted** cloud resources; as long as you're sure you don't need them. When deleting resources you have to follow a certain order (typically the reverse of how you created them...). For example, in the setup above, we'd have to shutdown and delete the instances first, then delete the interfaces on the router(s), then delete the router(s). Deleting a router with existing interfaces will not work.... and so on. Do the following in order listed.

1. Shutdown and delete your instances
2. Delete the interfaces on the router(s)
3. Delete the router(s)
4. Delete the network(s)
