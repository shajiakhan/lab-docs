# Take screenshots on Mac

There are multiple ways to take a screenshot. You can capture the entire screen, a portion of your screen, or an active window. You can also make video recordings of your screen as you perform some actions, if needed.

Keyboard shortcuts are listed below. You may also want to just use the [Screenshot App](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/take-a-screenshot-or-screen-recording-mh26782/mac).

## Screenshot of entire screen

> Press
>> ``Shift + Command + 3``
> to capture entire screen.

You'll see a little thumbnail toward the corner of your screen. Click the thumbnail to edit if you wish.

Screenshot file will also be saved to Desktop (unless you changed the default save location).

If you also want to copy the screenshot while you take it then hold the ``Control`` key in addition to the above. You can then directly paste the picture in applications such as Word.

## Screenshot of a portion of the screen

> Press
>> ``shift + command + 4``
> Drag your mouse to select the area you want captured (if you make a mistake, hit the ``Esc`` key to cancel). The screenshot is captured when you release your mouse button.
