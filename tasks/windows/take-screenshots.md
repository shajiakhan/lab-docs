# Take a screenshot on Windows 10

On Windows 10, there are multiple ways to take screenshots.

## The good old Print Screen

Print Screen is quick and useful if you just want to paste your screenshot in Microsoft Office applications (e.g., Word).

You can take a screenshot of your entire screen simply by hitting the Print Screen key. Typically, the key is spelled as ``prt sc`` or other variations such as ``Prnt Scrn``. On some keyboads you may have to combine with ``fn`` key (hold fn key and press prnt scrn).

Once you hit the Print Screen key, the screenshot of your entire screen is copied to your clipboard. Note, that there's no feedback (it looks like nothing happened) but rest assured the image is in your clipboard. You can then paste the screenshots anywhere you can paste images (e.g., Microsoft Word, Microsoft Paint, Paint 3D etc.)

### Taking screenshot of just your currently focused window with Print Screen

Just press ``Alt + Prnt Scrn`` to capture only the current window. Image is copied to clipboard and you can paste it in Word etc.

### Saving screenshots with Print Screen

Try ``Windows Logo Key + Prnt Scrn`` to capture your entire screen. Your screen will blink for a second. You can now paste (Ctrl + v) in applications such as Word, Paint, etc.

To find your saved screenshot, open File Explorer and go to ``Pictures -> Screenshots`` (full path is ``c:\Users\your_username\Pictures\Screenshots``)

## Snip & Sketch

You can open Snip & Sketch from your programs or use keyboard shortcut.

> Press
>> ``Ctrl + Shift + s`` to open Snip & Sketch and you then have options to drag your mouse to select the area of screen to be captured, or capture an active window, or full screen.
>

Image is immediately copied to your clipboard and you'll also see a notification (bottom right) where you could open that image in Snip & Sketch to put simple annotations (e.g., higlight, simple shapes etc.). Once done, you can save the image to use it elsewhere (e.g., insert in Word through "Insert->Image...").

## Screenshots of VirtualBox Virtual Machines

As virtual machines require keyboard and mouse input taken away from the host computer, it's best to ensure that the keyboard and mouse input are back to your host computer before taking a screenshot of a VM running in a VirtualBox Window.

Typically, this can be easily done by just clicking OUT of the VirtualBox window (anywhere on your host computer screen). Once keyboard/mouse control is back to your host computer, you can use any of the above methods to take your screenshot.

You can also use your host key (typically the right hand side ``CTRL`` key) to toggle control between your VM and your host computer.
