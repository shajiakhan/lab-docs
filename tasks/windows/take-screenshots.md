# Take a screenshot on Windows 10

On Windows 10, there are multiple ways to take screenshots.

## The good old Print Screen

Print Screen is quick and useful if you just want to paste your screenshot in Microsoft Office applications (e.g., Word).

You can take a screenshot of your entire screen simply by hitting the Print Screen key. Typically, the key is spelled as ``prt sc`` or other variations such as ``Prnt Scrn``. One some laptops you may have to combine with ``fn`` key (hold fn key and press prnt sc).

Once you hit the Print Screen key, the screenshot of your entire screen is copied to your clipboard. You can then paste the screenshots anywhere you can paste images (e.g., Microsoft Word, Microsoft Paint, Paint 3D etc.)

### Taking screenshot of just your currently focused window with Print Screen
Just press ``Alt + prt sc`` to capture only the current window. Image is copied to clipboard and you can paste it in Word etc.

### Saving screenshots with Print Screen
Try ``Windows Logo Key  + PrtScn`` to capture your entire screen. Your screen will blink for a second.You can now paste (Ctrl + v) in applications such as Word, Paint, etc. 

To find your saved screenshot, open File Explorer and go to ``Pictures -> Screenshots`` (full path is ``c:\\Users\your_username\Pictures\Screenshots``)

## Snip & Sketch

You can open Snip & Sketch from your programs or use keyboard shortcuts.

> Easiest shortcut is to press
>> ``ctrl + shift + s`` to open Snip & Sketch and you then have options to drag your mouse to select the area of screen to be captured, or capture an active window, or full screen.

Image is immediately copied to your clipboard and you'll also see a notification (bottom right) where you could open that image in Snip & Sketch to put simple annotations (e.g., higlight, simple shapes etc.). Once done, you can save the image to use it elsewhere (e.g., insert in Word).
